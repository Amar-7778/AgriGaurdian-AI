# Crop Disease Prevention Guidelines

## Early warning principles
- Most fungal disease outbreaks are preceded by humidity spikes, warm temperatures, and prolonged wet leaf surfaces.
- Early intervention should prioritize microclimate control before chemical intervention.

## High humidity risk actions
- Improve canopy airflow through pruning and spacing.
- Avoid evening irrigation to reduce overnight leaf wetness.
- Prefer drip irrigation over overhead sprinklers.

## Rain-driven risk actions
- Intensify field scouting after rainfall events and in low-airflow zones.
- Remove infected debris and sanitize tools to reduce spread.

## Chemical control guidance
- Use fungicides only when integrated pest management thresholds are met.
- Rotate active ingredients to reduce resistance.
- Follow local agronomist and regulatory guidelines for dose and pre-harvest intervals.
