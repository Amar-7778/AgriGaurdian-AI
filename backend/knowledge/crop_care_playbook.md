# Crop Care Playbook

## Tomato
- High risk period: warm and humid conditions.
- Watch for foliar fungal diseases after repeated rainfall.
- Maintain balanced nitrogen to avoid dense canopies.

## Rice
- Standing water and warm humidity increase disease pressure.
- Monitor early tillering and reproductive stages closely.

## Wheat
- Risk increases with prolonged dew and moderate temperatures.
- Avoid excess irrigation near heading stage.

## Field checklist for high risk
1. Verify drainage and remove standing water pockets.
2. Inspect lower leaves and shaded areas first.
3. Isolate suspected infected plants and document spread.
4. Re-check environmental data every 2–4 hours.
